Markulator 

Markulator is a simple web tool that helps students calculate the minimum marks they need to score in their end semester exam (out of 100) in order to achieve a specific final grade (like 8, 9, or 10 GPA) in their marksheet.

🚀 Features

 - 🎯 Calculates the minimum required marks for 8, 9, and 10 GPA targets

 - ⚠️ Displays error messages for invalid inputs

 - 🔒 Validates if input marks are between 0 and 50

 - ❌ Shows "Not obtainable" if the required marks exceed 100

 - 🌙 Modern dark mode UI

✅ Example


If you’ve scored 35 out of 50 in internals, and you want a final score of 80 (which may correspond to a 9 GPA),
Markulator will tell you the minimum marks you need in end sem = 90.
